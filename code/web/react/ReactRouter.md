## Navigates pages using react router rather than request the server to change.

- exact matches the path if it contains it rather than if its exactly right
- router basically decides on the component it is depending on the route that is currently present, used commonly for switching the page components.

- switch prevents rendering beyond a route being rendered.
- Acts on a single page, just uses the URL features to dictate which components to bound and unmount etc.
