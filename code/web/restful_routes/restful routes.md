### Get

- data sent via query string
- Information plainly visible in URL
- Limited amount of data can be sent

### Post

- Used to post data to the server
- used to write/create/update

## REST

- Representational state transfer
- REST is an *architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems*
- It is a set of guidelines for how the client / server should communicate and perform crud operations on some given resource.

---

- Main idea of REST is treating data on the server side as resources than can be CRUDed
- The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URLs and HTTP verbs in your applications.
- Resource is any entity present on site such as a tweet for example in twitter.
