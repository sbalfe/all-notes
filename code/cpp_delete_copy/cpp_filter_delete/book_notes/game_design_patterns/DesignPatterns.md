# Design patterns

## Factory method

- Define a method for creating objects without explicitly instantiating them with a constructor call.

```c++

class Product {
 public:
  virtual ~Product() {}
  virtual std::string Operation() const = 0;
};


class ConcreteProduct1 : public Product {
 public:
  std::string Operation() const override {
    return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct1}";
  }
};
class ConcreteProduct2 : public Product {
 public:
  std::string Operation() const override {
    return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct2}";
  }
};

class Creator {

 public:
  virtual ~Creator(){};
  virtual Product* FactoryMethod() const = 0;

  std::string SomeOperation() const {
    Product* product = this->FactoryMethod();
    std::string result = "Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with " + product->Operation();
    delete product;
    return result;
  }
};

/*  
    factories that implement creator, define a different product for each one
	this therefore calls the correct operation when someOperation is called.
*/
class ConcreteCreator1 : public Creator {
 public:
  Product* FactoryMethod() const override {
    return new ConcreteProduct1();
  }
};

class ConcreteCreator2 : public Creator {
 public:
  Product* FactoryMethod() const override {
    return new ConcreteProduct2();
  }
};

void ClientCode(const Creator& creator) {
  std::cout << "Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.\n"
            << creator.SomeOperation() << std::endl;
}


int main() {
  std::cout << "App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.\n";
  Creator* creator = new ConcreteCreator1();
  ClientCode(*creator);
  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.\n";
  Creator* creator2 = new ConcreteCreator2();
  ClientCode(*creator2);

  delete creator;
  delete creator2;
  return 0;
}
```

## Abstract Factory

- Objects are A and B
- variants are 1 and 2.
- 4 selections, A1, A2, B1, B2.

---

- We create object hierarchy for each product and its various variants
- we create abstract factory that each product type is created from
- the abstract factory is inherited into factories that deal with specific product types

```c++
/**
 * Each distinct product of a product family should have a base interface. All
 * variants of the product must implement this interface.
 */
class AbstractProductA {
 public:
  virtual ~AbstractProductA(){};
  virtual std::string UsefulFunctionA() const = 0;
};

/**
 * Concrete Products are created by corresponding Concrete Factories.
 */
class ConcreteProductA1 : public AbstractProductA {
 public:
  std::string UsefulFunctionA() const override {
    return "The result of the product A1.";
  }
};

class ConcreteProductA2 : public AbstractProductA {
  std::string UsefulFunctionA() const override {
    return "The result of the product A2.";
  }
};

/**
 * Here's the the base interface of another product. All products can interact
 * with each other, but proper interaction is possible only between products of
 * the same concrete variant.
 */
class AbstractProductB {
  /**
   * Product B is able to do its own thing...
   */
 public:
  virtual ~AbstractProductB(){};
  virtual std::string UsefulFunctionB() const = 0;
  /**
   * ...but it also can collaborate with the ProductA.
   *
   * The Abstract Factory makes sure that all products it creates are of the
   * same variant and thus, compatible.
   */
  virtual std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const = 0;
};

/**
 * Concrete Products are created by corresponding Concrete Factories.
 */
class ConcreteProductB1 : public AbstractProductB {
 public:
  std::string UsefulFunctionB() const override {
    return "The result of the product B1.";
  }
  /**
   * The variant, Product B1, is only able to work correctly with the variant,
   * Product A1. Nevertheless, it accepts any instance of AbstractProductA as an
   * argument.
   */
  std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const override {
    const std::string result = collaborator.UsefulFunctionA();
    return "The result of the B1 collaborating with ( " + result + " )";
  }
};

class ConcreteProductB2 : public AbstractProductB {
 public:
  std::string UsefulFunctionB() const override {
    return "The result of the product B2.";
  }
  /**
   * The variant, Product B2, is only able to work correctly with the variant,
   * Product A2. Nevertheless, it accepts any instance of AbstractProductA as an
   * argument.
   */
  std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const override {
    const std::string result = collaborator.UsefulFunctionA();
    return "The result of the B2 collaborating with ( " + result + " )";
  }
};

/**
 * The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of methods that return
 * different abstract products. These products are called a family and are
 * related by a high-level theme or concept. Products of one family are usually
 * able to collaborate among themselves. A family of products may have several
 * variants, but the products of one variant are incompatible with products of
 * another.
 */
class AbstractFactory {
 public:
  virtual AbstractProductA *CreateProductA() const = 0;
  virtual AbstractProductB *CreateProductB() const = 0;
};

/**
 * Concrete Factories produce a family of products that belong to a single
 * variant. The factory guarantees that resulting products are compatible. Note
 * that signatures of the Concrete Factory's methods return an abstract product,
 * while inside the method a concrete product is instantiated.
 */
class ConcreteFactory1 : public AbstractFactory {
 public:
  AbstractProductA *CreateProductA() const override {
    return new ConcreteProductA1();
  }
  AbstractProductB *CreateProductB() const override {
    return new ConcreteProductB1();
  }
};

/**
 * Each Concrete Factory has a corresponding product variant.
 */
class ConcreteFactory2 : public AbstractFactory {
 public:
  AbstractProductA *CreateProductA() const override {
    return new ConcreteProductA2();
  }
  AbstractProductB *CreateProductB() const override {
    return new ConcreteProductB2();
  }
};

/**
 * The client code works with factories and products only through abstract
 * types: AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct. This lets you pass any factory or
 * product subclass to the client code without breaking it.
 */

void ClientCode(const AbstractFactory &factory) {
    
    /* given the variant, now select what product of this variant to create.*/
  const AbstractProductA *product_a = factory.CreateProductA();
  const AbstractProductB *product_b = factory.CreateProductB();
  std::cout << product_b->UsefulFunctionB() << "\n";
  std::cout << product_b->AnotherUsefulFunctionB(*product_a) << "\n";
  delete product_a;
  delete product_b;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << "Client: Testing client code with the first factory type:\n";
    
    /* what variant factory do we wish to create*/
  ConcreteFactory1 *f1 = new ConcreteFactory1();
  ClientCode(*f1);
  delete f1;
  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Client: Testing the same client code with the second factory type:\n";

}
```

## Builder

- Construct objects step by step.
