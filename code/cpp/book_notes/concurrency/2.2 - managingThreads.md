# Chapter 2 - Managing Threads
- **C++** program has a **single thread** that is started by the **C++ runtime**
- There is a **thread running** the `main()` 
- Launch **more threads** that have a **function** as the **entry point**
---
- New threads will **run concurrently** , when the **entry point returns**, they will **exit**
- `std::thread` can be **waited** for in **finishing** 

## Launching A Thread
- Construct `std::thread` to specify some **task to run** on a **thread**
	- Task may be a **==functor==** that may **take additional parameters** 
		- *Stops* when its **signalled to**.

```c++
#include <thread>

void do_some_work();
std::thread my_thread(do_some_work);
```

> Always include `<thread>` header.

- `std::thread` works with any **callable type**
	- Pass an **instance** of some *class* with a **function call operator** implemented.

```c++
class background_task
{
public:
    void operator()() const
    {
        do_something();
        do_something_else();
    }
};
background_task f;
std::thread my_thread(f);

```

- Avoid the **most vexing parse** $\to$ passing a *temporary* rather than a *named variable* the syntax matches that of a *function declaration*.

- Use *uniform initialisation syntax*

```c++
std::thread my_thread {background_task()};
```

- Alternatively use a **lambda expression**

```c++
std::thread my_thread([](){
	do_something();
	do_something_else();
})
```

- Must decided to **join** or **detach** thread otherwise it calls `std::terminate` when it goes out **of scope**

- Another issue is a thread going out of scope with **local variable access**

```c++
struct func
{
	int& i;
	func(int& i_):i(i_){}
	
	void operator()()
	{
		for(unsigned j=0;j<1000000;++j)
		{
			do_something(i);
		}
	}
};

void oops()
{
	int some_local_state=0;
	func my_func(some_local_state);
	std::thread my_thread(my_func); /* local variable access*/
	my_thread.detach(); /* run in bg thus losing access to local variable*/
}
```

- Solution would be to **copy** the data into the **thread** rather than *sharing data*.
- Alternatively just `.join()` the thread.

## Waiting for a thread to complete
- Call `join()` on `std::thread` instance. 
- Needing more **fine grained control** 
	- Check whether a **thread is finished**.
	- Wait a **certain period of time**
	- Condition variables
	- Futures.
- `join()` $\to$ cleans up **any storage associated** 
- Only call *once* on `std::thread` as it loses the **association** with the finished thread.

## Waiting in exceptional Circumstances
