# Packages

- Class and interface names are going to conflict
- Mechanism required to fully specify class.
- Allow same class in the same project using packages.

## Use cases

- Programmers can easily determine that classes are related
- easy to know where to find classes / interfaces that can provide the functions provided by the package
- package creates a new namespace , class and interface name conflicts are avoided.
- Classes within the package can have unrestricted access to one another while still restricting access for classes outside the package.
