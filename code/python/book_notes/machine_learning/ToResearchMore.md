  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkpsruJC5Mk - encapsulates entire dual problem as a whole

  https://youtu.be/6-ntMIaJpm0 - dual problem for svm

  https://youtu.be/yuqB-d5MjZA - Lagrange multipliers basic

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ4UNu1P2kw - lagrangian in depth.

  https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machines-dual-formulation-quadratic-programming-sequential-minimal-optimization-57f4387ce4dd - covers the derivation of the dual form using partial derivatives and lagrangian multiplier basis, note our version down there is flipped to be a minimization so its multiplied the other way around

- Entropy / Information theory.

- Cart cost function for regression
