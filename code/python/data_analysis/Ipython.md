# Data Science - Ipython

- Extension to python to enable a better control panel for **data scientists**

- IPython is about using Python effectively for interactive scientific and data-intensive computing.
- This chapter will start by stepping through some of the IPython features that are useful to the practice of data science, focusing especially on the syntax it offers beyond the standard features of Python.
- Next, we will go into a bit more depth on some of the more useful "magic commands" that can speed-up common tasks in creating and using data science code.
- Finally, we will touch on some of the features of the notebook that make it useful in understanding data and sharing results
