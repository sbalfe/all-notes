# Pandas

- standards for **Panel-data**
- Its the most popular library for data handling for Python and is built directly off of NumPy.
- Read in data -> clean -> perform feature engineering. 



- Relies on core data structure - > **series** -> numpy array with named index.
- **Dataframe** -> a data 'matrix' with labelled index and columns



## Panda series

- Pandas series is very similar to a numpy array, except for the addition of a named index
- We can use this named index to grab data from the array
- Lets see how this works with python. 

## Data Frame

- main tool with working with data in this course
- Data Frame is simply multiple panda series that share the same index 
- Think of a data frame as being similar to a spreadsheet , just far powerful
