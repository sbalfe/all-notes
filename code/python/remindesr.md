# Reminders

### general

- Private variables (not enforced) are `_` and `__` , where `__` means you must use the mangled var `_classname__var_` to access `__var` inside `classname` class.

### architecture

- Consider using packages which are a group of related files (module files) to contain some functionality.
- Structure the packages in such a way that uses composition.
- Enforce design patterns where required.
