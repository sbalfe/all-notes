# Improving Data structures

## Improving priority queues: d-ways heaps

### Problem - Handling priority

- Sort tasks based on how important they are

#### Priority in practice - Bug tracking

- Bug tracking suited designed to sort the bugs that should be solved first.

- Prioritize as of **lack of resources**.
- Tasks added always.

### Solutions - Keep sorted list

- Update **sorted list** every time an **item inserted**.

## From sorted list to priority queues

- Gives us **partial ordering of element**.
