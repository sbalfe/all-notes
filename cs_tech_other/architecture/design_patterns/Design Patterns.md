# Design Patterns

### Adapter

- We have some class that defines a domain specific interface to be used called *Target*
- We have some class that has an incompatible interface called the *Adaptee*
- We wrap the incompatible interface class in an *Adapter* which will be passed to the *Target* and *Adapter* will do any necessary conversions from the *Adaptee* logic such that its now compatible with what *Target* expects.
- The code principle is that the client code business logic relies on a very specific output for the class it works on therefore an adapter ensures an object being passed to it works as intended.

> Spotify Tool Example
>
> - We would only use this in place of a Bridge pattern to adapt some third party code that is incompatible with our client code.
> - The logic of this third party is okay, but the output is not compatible with how we have already built the application therefore we may wish to construct an adapter.
> - In our tool this may be some playlist analyser tool that outputs results in XML, but if our playlist package relies on JSON we require an adapter to be passed to our package that will convert it under the hood and act as if it perfectly produce the JSON output we want.
> - This may also come in handy if we develop our own specific data formatting structure.

```python
class Target:
    """
    The Target defines the domain-specific interface used by the client code.
    """

    def request(self) -> str:
        return "Target: The default target's behavior."


class Adaptee:
    """
    The Adaptee contains some useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
    with the existing client code. The Adaptee needs some adaptation before the
    client code can use it.
    """

    def specific_request(self) -> str:
        return ".eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS"


class Adapter(Target):
    """
    The Adapter makes the Adaptee's interface compatible with the Target's
    interface via composition.
    """

    def __init__(self, adaptee: Adaptee) -> None:
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self) -> str:
        return f"Adapter: (TRANSLATED) {self.adaptee.specific_request()[::-1]}"


def client_code(target: Target) -> None:
    """
    The client code supports all classes that follow the Target interface.
    """

    print(target.request(), end="")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:")
    target = Target()
    client_code(target)
    print("\n")

    adaptee = Adaptee()
    print("Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. "
          "See, I don't understand it:")
    print(f"Adaptee: {adaptee.specific_request()}", end="\n\n")

    print("Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:")
    adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
    client_code(adapter)
```

### Bridge

- We maintain one class class referred to as the *Abstraction* which works on a variety of different *Implementations*.
- Each *Implementation* can be created to define the functionality for a specific operation that is different. This may be used for example if we are using different APIs.
- The client code will simply work with some *Abstraction* object and call the function on it, but the hidden implementation that the *Abstraction* is composed of will be used to perform the operation.

> Spotify Tool Example
>
> - We may use a bridge in such a way that allows the underlying API we use to fetch listening data is hidden. We may collect data from YouTube Music, Soundcloud etc.
> - So we can offer an abstraction interface which, depending on the injected implementation, will perform the desired API call.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Abstraction:
    """
    The Abstraction defines the interface for the "control" part of the two
    class hierarchies. It maintains a reference to an object of the
    Implementation hierarchy and delegates all of the real work to this object.
    """

    def __init__(self, implementation: Implementation) -> None:
        self.implementation = implementation

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return (f"Abstraction: Base operation with:\n"
                f"{self.implementation.operation_implementation()}")


class ExtendedAbstraction(Abstraction):
    """
    You can extend the Abstraction without changing the Implementation classes.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return (f"ExtendedAbstraction: Extended operation with:\n"
                f"{self.implementation.operation_implementation()}")


class Implementation(ABC):
    """
    The Implementation defines the interface for all implementation classes. It
    doesn't have to match the Abstraction's interface. In fact, the two
    interfaces can be entirely different. Typically the Implementation interface
    provides only primitive operations, while the Abstraction defines higher-
    level operations based on those primitives.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def operation_implementation(self) -> str:
        pass


"""
Each Concrete Implementation corresponds to a specific platform and implements
the Implementation interface using that platform's API.
"""


class ConcreteImplementationA(Implementation):
    def operation_implementation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteImplementationA: Here's the result on the platform A."


class ConcreteImplementationB(Implementation):
    def operation_implementation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteImplementationB: Here's the result on the platform B."


def client_code(abstraction: Abstraction) -> None:
    """
    Except for the initialization phase, where an Abstraction object gets linked
    with a specific Implementation object, the client code should only depend on
    the Abstraction class. This way the client code can support any abstraction-
    implementation combination.
    """

    # ...

    print(abstraction.operation(), end="")

    # ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    """
    The client code should be able to work with any pre-configured abstraction-
    implementation combination.
    """

    implementation = ConcreteImplementationA()
    abstraction = Abstraction(implementation)
    client_code(abstraction)

    print("\n")

    implementation = ConcreteImplementationB()
    abstraction = ExtendedAbstraction(implementation)
    client_code(abstraction)
```

### Facade

- Simple idea where we have a class that is composed of a complex variety of sub class logic that is hidden from the end user.

- A Facades main goal is to isolate a subsection of your complex API to perform only a specific task.

> Spotify Tool Example
>
> - We may want a Facade for something such as Song Validation, where we analyse if a user may like a specific song based on factors.

```python
from __future__ import annotations


class Facade:
    """
    The Facade class provides a simple interface to the complex logic of one or
    several subsystems. The Facade delegates the client requests to the
    appropriate objects within the subsystem. The Facade is also responsible for
    managing their lifecycle. All of this shields the client from the undesired
    complexity of the subsystem.
    """

    def __init__(self, subsystem1: Subsystem1, subsystem2: Subsystem2) -> None:
        """
        Depending on your application's needs, you can provide the Facade with
        existing subsystem objects or force the Facade to create them on its
        own.
        """

        self._subsystem1 = subsystem1 or Subsystem1()
        self._subsystem2 = subsystem2 or Subsystem2()

    def operation(self) -> str:
        """
        The Facade's methods are convenient shortcuts to the sophisticated
        functionality of the subsystems. However, clients get only to a fraction
        of a subsystem's capabilities.
        """

        results = []
        results.append("Facade initializes subsystems:")
        results.append(self._subsystem1.operation1())
        results.append(self._subsystem2.operation1())
        results.append("Facade orders subsystems to perform the action:")
        results.append(self._subsystem1.operation_n())
        results.append(self._subsystem2.operation_z())
        return "\n".join(results)


class Subsystem1:
    """
    The Subsystem can accept requests either from the facade or client directly.
    In any case, to the Subsystem, the Facade is yet another client, and it's
    not a part of the Subsystem.
    """

    def operation1(self) -> str:
        return "Subsystem1: Ready!"

    # ...

    def operation_n(self) -> str:
        return "Subsystem1: Go!"


class Subsystem2:
    """
    Some facades can work with multiple subsystems at the same time.
    """

    def operation1(self) -> str:
        return "Subsystem2: Get ready!"

    # ...

    def operation_z(self) -> str:
        return "Subsystem2: Fire!"


def client_code(facade: Facade) -> None:
    """
    The client code works with complex subsystems through a simple interface
    provided by the Facade. When a facade manages the lifecycle of the
    subsystem, the client might not even know about the existence of the
    subsystem. This approach lets you keep the complexity under control.
    """

    print(facade.operation(), end="")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The client code may have some of the subsystem's objects already created.
    # In this case, it might be worthwhile to initialize the Facade with these
    # objects instead of letting the Facade create new instances.
    subsystem1 = Subsystem1()
    subsystem2 = Subsystem2()
    facade = Facade(subsystem1, subsystem2)
    client_code(facade)
```

### Decorator

- We essentially take some class and create a *Decorator* class that wraps around it. The *Decorator* has the same interface as its underlying class such that we can easily extend the functionality further.
- The key with the decorator pattern is copying the interface of some component and then using this as a method add plugins or custom features
- The decorators can be stacked as a result similar to the **Chain of Responsibility** but there is never really a break in the chain.

```python
class Component():
    """
    The base Component interface defines operations that can be altered by
    decorators.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass


class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    """
    Concrete Components provide default implementations of the operations. There
    might be several variations of these classes.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "ConcreteComponent"


class Decorator(Component):
    """
    The base Decorator class follows the same interface as the other components.
    The primary purpose of this class is to define the wrapping interface for
    all concrete decorators. The default implementation of the wrapping code
    might include a field for storing a wrapped component and the means to
    initialize it.
    """

    _component: Component = None

    def __init__(self, component: Component) -> None:
        self._component = component

    @property
    def component(self) -> Component:
        """
        The Decorator delegates all work to the wrapped component.
        """

        return self._component

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return self._component.operation()


class ConcreteDecoratorA(Decorator):
    """
    Concrete Decorators call the wrapped object and alter its result in some
    way.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        """
        Decorators may call parent implementation of the operation, instead of
        calling the wrapped object directly. This approach simplifies extension
        of decorator classes.
        """
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorA({self.component.operation()})"


class ConcreteDecoratorB(Decorator):
    """
    Decorators can execute their behavior either before or after the call to a
    wrapped object.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorB({self.component.operation()})"


def client_code(component: Component) -> None:
    """
    The client code works with all objects using the Component interface. This
    way it can stay independent of the concrete classes of components it works
    with.
    """

    # ...

    print(f"RESULT: {component.operation()}", end="")

    # ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This way the client code can support both simple components...
    simple = ConcreteComponent()
    print("Client: I've got a simple component:")
    client_code(simple)
    print("\n")

    # ...as well as decorated ones.
    #
    # Note how decorators can wrap not only simple components but the other
    # decorators as well.
    decorator1 = ConcreteDecoratorA(simple)
    decorator2 = ConcreteDecoratorB(decorator1)
    print("Client: Now I've got a decorated component:")
    client_code(decorator2)
```

### Chain of Responsibility

- Various handlers operate on some request and may at some point run some function based on the request data or pass it down the chain

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Optional


class Handler(ABC):
    """
    The Handler interface declares a method for building the chain of handlers.
    It also declares a method for executing a request.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def set_next(self, handler: Handler) -> Handler:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, request) -> Optional[str]:
        pass


class AbstractHandler(Handler):
    """
    The default chaining behavior can be implemented inside a base handler
    class.
    """

    _next_handler: Handler = None

    def set_next(self, handler: Handler) -> Handler:
        self._next_handler = handler
        # Returning a handler from here will let us link handlers in a
        # convenient way like this:
        # monkey.set_next(squirrel).set_next(dog)
        return handler

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, request: Any) -> str:
        if self._next_handler:
            return self._next_handler.handle(request)

        return None


"""
All Concrete Handlers either handle a request or pass it to the next handler in
the chain.
"""


class MonkeyHandler(AbstractHandler):
    def handle(self, request: Any) -> str:
        if request == "Banana":
            return f"Monkey: I'll eat the {request}"
        else:
            return super().handle(request)


class SquirrelHandler(AbstractHandler):
    def handle(self, request: Any) -> str:
        if request == "Nut":
            return f"Squirrel: I'll eat the {request}"

def client_code(handler: Handler) -> None:
    """

    cases, it is not even aware that the handler is part of a chain.

        print(f"\nClient: Who wants a {food}?")
        result = handler.handle(food)
