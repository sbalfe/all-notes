# Interests and debt

## Compound interest

- Compound interest
  -  Figure out how quickly something compounds
    - Money builds as we reuse money each year to create an increase in profit

---

- 100 $\to$ 10% compounding annually $\to$ 110 after 1 year, figure out value after $n$ years.

$$
100 \cdot (1.1)^n
$$

- How long does it take to double money:

$$
100(1.1)^x = 200
$$

- Solve for $x$ to figure this value out.

### Rule of 72 for compound interest

- Rule in terms of 72 to approximate the value of the logarithm calculation in terms of how to double our money
  - 10% $\to$ 72/10 = 7.2 years to double our money

## Interest (simple / compound)

- Money we pay to keep the money for some period of time
- 100 -> 110 = 10$ interest rate.
- Initial deposit = **==the principle==** 
- Simple $\to$ percentage of the principle is earned each time would decreases in profit essentially over time
  - Compound interest is where we take 10% of the increased ammount and thus can increase much more over time.
